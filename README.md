## About project

This is a simple task list. I wrote it back in November in pure JavaScript and SCSS, but later I changed my mind about writing code.

So, in March, I built this project with Gulp, translated it to TypeScript, and completely refactored the code. I rewrote the code into classes and divided them into understandable methods.

When refactoring, I used the principles of KISS, DRY and the Single Responsibility principle.
